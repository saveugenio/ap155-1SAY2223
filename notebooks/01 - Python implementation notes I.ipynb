These may be integers, strings, or lists of data. These fields are to be manipulated and mutated by a set of instructions, called methods.\n",

    "Of course, we know that **i** and **1** are both integers. But Python doesn't know that! So it needs to do this complicated dance of checking and cross checking just to add two variables. The convenience we get for being able to multiply strings and integers and floating points together comes with it slower run times.\n",

However, notice that **sum_while** goes through two Pythonic arithmetic operations, while **sum_for** only goes through one Pythonic arithmetic operation. We may add an extraneous Pythonic addition just to confirm the intuition that the two pieces of code becomes comparable in speed."
