    "There are some codes where I did not use NumPy and other packages. I simply could have used them but I wanted to try to code the method manually using built-in functions in Python. I also created codes (without NumPy and other packages) for creating m by n zero matrices, creating n by n identity matrices, and performing matrix multiplication on an m by p to a p by n matrix. I could have used nested lists instead of NumPy arrays, but I have decided not to pursue it anymore since the assert statements require NumPy."
